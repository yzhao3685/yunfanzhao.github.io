I am an AI Scientist at GE Healthcare. I was a postdoc in Computer Science at Harvard
University, advised by [Prof. Milind Tambe](https://teamcore.seas.harvard.edu/tambe). I completed my Ph.D. in Operations Research at Columbia University, advised by [Prof. Adam Elmachtoub](http://www.columbia.edu/~ae2516/). I received my B.S. / M.S. in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Johns Hopkins University.  

I mainly work on (i) LLMs and foundation models (ii) reinforcement learning (iii) the intersection of optimization and machine learning. 

I co-organized [the 5th International Workshop on Autonomous Agents for Social Good (AASG) 2024](https://panosd.eu/aasg2024/), in conjunction with the 23rd International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems.
