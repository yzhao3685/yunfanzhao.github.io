I am a Ph.D. student in the Industrial Engineering and Operations Research department at Columbia University, advised by [Prof. Adam Elmachtoub](http://www.columbia.edu/~ae2516/). I received my B.S. and my M.S. in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Johns Hopkins University, both in 2018.  

I am mainly interested in (i) policy evaluation and learning (ii) the intersection of optimization and machine learning. I also worked on active learning and combinatorics.
